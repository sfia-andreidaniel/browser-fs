<h1>Which are the technologies that OneDB is using?</h1>
<p><b>OneDB is built only with free technologies</b>. Practically, it is a beautifull thing
   made up from the ground with this thing in mind</p>
<p>Take a look at the list of requirements that you should meet in order to install OneDB:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Linux</b> operating system (recommended, but also works on Windows too). A recommended Linux distribution would be a debian based one.</li>
    <li><b>Apache</b> WebServer</li>
    <li><b>PHP 5.3.6</b></li>
    <li><b>mongoDB</b> (recommended the latest version)</li>
    <li><b>ffmpeg</b> (for video transcoding on the fly)</li>
    <li>Image editors are provided by the guys from <b>Pixlr.com website</b>, which built a wonderful tool for image editing</li>
    <li><b>jsPlatform</b> - which is the framework web operating system used to build OneDB backend, which
        at by itself it requires:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Google Chrome</b> or <b>Safari</b> web browser (alhtough might work on Firefox, but not tested yet)</li>
            <li><b>MySQL</b> database system</li>
            <li>Rich interface controls were integrated into jsPlatform from the following projects:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>TinyMCE editor</b></li>
                    <li><b>Ace</b> Ajax.org Cloud 9 Editor</li>
