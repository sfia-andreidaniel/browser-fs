<h1>How does OneDB makes things easy for me?</h1>
<p>In contrast to other CMS systems, which reinvented the wheel and built their own
   backend administration interface, OneDB, with the help of JSPlatform (the core that
   stands at it's backend foundation) camed with the simplest solution: <b>an administration
   panel similar to existing operating systems</b>.
</p>
<p>So, <b>if you're familiar with the world's most popular programs</b> like: Windows Explorer (who doesn't? :)), 
   Microsoft Word, drag'n'drop, intuitive things, this makes you a ready to go user for the OneDB.
</p>
<p>Also, <b>if you have multiple websites</b> built with OneDB, you can administer them all from
   a single location, meaning that you won't have to use multiple url's, multiple administration
   interfaces, multiple cms backends, and so on
