<h1>Why should I use OneDB?</h1>
<h2>From a site owner point of view</h2>
<p>OneDB is open source, meaning that you have full access to it's source code. After your website is ready,
   you can easily hire a
   web developer to extend it's functionality (although you probably won't need that becase it is very
   probably that those features are just right there implemented for you).
</p>
<h2>From a site administrator point of view</h2>
<p>It has a very intuitive interface, and it was built with ergonomy, multitasking features, and performance in mind.
</p>
<h2>From a programmer point of view</h2>
<p>After you'll take a look at the features of OneDB, you'll just simply love it.</p>
<p>It brings you the power and flexibility you would have building a site from the ground,
   but in the same time it makes your life easy so you won't even notice when your job
   is ready.
