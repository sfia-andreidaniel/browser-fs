</p>

<p>OneDB interface is divided into 4 main components:<br />

    <b>2. Toolbar</b><br />
    <b>3. Tree Panel</b><br />
    <b>4. View Panel</b>
</p>
<hr />


<h3>1. Menu</h3>
<p>From the window menu, you can do most of the operations in OneDB, although
   some menu items have keyboard shortcuts assigned, in order to speed the
   things up
</p>
<p>We'll speak about all entries in the menu, and what are their functions
</p>
<p>At this point, the menu is composed by these elements:
    <ul>
        <li><b>OneDB</b> - used for mongoDB database connections and database related stuff</li>
        <li><b>File</b> - used for articles / files / categories management (creation, upload, etc.)</li>
        <li><b>Edit</b> - used for renaming, cutting, pasting and deleting items</li>
        <li><b>View</b> - used for customising the look and feeel of the interface</li>
        <li><b>Tools</b> - used mostly by programmers, for managing sub-components of OneDB</li>
        <li><b>Help</b> - used for obtaining help about the application</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<hr />


<h3>2. Toolbar</h3>
<p>From the toolbar you can do at any time most application common operations, such as refreshing content, modify the look
   of the view panel, etc.
</p>
<p>You can safely play with the toolbar buttons, as there is nothing you can do to mess the thins up</p>
<hr />


<h3>3. Tree Panel</h3>
<p>The tree panel is a point from where you can easily navigate into data locations, by simply clicking the
   items of the tree.
</p>
<p>Also, the tree has a drag and drop feature, from where you can <b>arrange categories</b> in database,
   meaning that the order that you see in the backend, that order will be used by programmers when they
   are listing stuff on your website.
</p>
<p>Category folders displayed on the tree have some meaning:
   <ul>
        <li><img src="" /> - Undiscovered Offline folder. The folder is offline, and OneDB has not yet navigated yet inside
           that folder, meaning that it don't know it's sub-folders structure.
        </li>
        <li><img src="" /> -Undiscovered Online folder. The folder is online, and OneDB has not yet navigated inside that
           folder, meaning that it don't know it's sub-folders structure.
        </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<hr />

<h3>4. View Panel</h3>
<p>The view panel is the region where are displayed items from the focused element from the tree panel. This means
   than whenever you click a folder in the tree panel, it's content is loaded displayed in the view panel.
