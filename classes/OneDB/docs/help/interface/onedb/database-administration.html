<p>By clicking this menu option, a window like this will open:<br />
   <img src="img/database-administration.png" />
</p>
<p>This information is very usefull for developers, especially for determining
   the space used by your site in your database. When you create an item into
   your database, after you delete it, it's occupied space is not deleted.
   In order to reclaim the deleted space or repair your mongoDB database, you should click the button
   <b>Repair / Defrag</b>. The role of that button is to re-index the database,
   reclaim the deleted space occupied by deleleted items, and so on.
</p>
<p style="color: red">The <b>Repair / Defrag</b> button should be clicked only by website administrators. Please take
  caution, as you could mess your website if pressing that button when not instructed!!!
