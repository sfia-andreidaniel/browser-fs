<h1>OneDB -> Prepare server for first usage</h1>
<p>This option is usefull for your site administrators, and should be runned just one time, or when instructed by oneDB support stuff.<br />

   is creating the cache folders locally into oneDB classes folder, etc. If any problems are encoutered,
   a developer should check if the folder "classes/oneDB/cache/mongodb-server-name/mongodb-database/" is writeable
   by the apache process.
