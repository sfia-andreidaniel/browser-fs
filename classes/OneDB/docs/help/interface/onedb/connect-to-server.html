<h1>OneDB -> Connect to server</h1>
<p>
    Clicking this menu item, a new window will apear:<br />
    <img src="img/connect-to-server.png" />
</p>

<p>From this dialog you can start a new session on your OneDB database. You can connect to the database
   in two different ways.
</p>
<p>Either provide a database <b>Host</b>name, <b>Database name</b>, <b>User Name</b> and a <b>Password</b>,
   either by using an allready connection saved in the past from the dropdown below, and click on the button <b>Load</b>.
   If you <b>Load</b> a connection, all fields will be auto completed with the values you typed in last time
   you connected and saved that connection.
</p>

<p><h2>So, basically, this is the flow:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>First time connection to the site</b>:<br />
            Type in the <b>Host</b>, <b>Database Name</b>, <b>UserName</b> and <b>Password</b> provided by your
            site administrator or developer.<br />
            If you want that information to be auto completed next time you will open OneDB, also check the
            <b>Remember Connection</b> checkbox.<br />
            <b>Do not forget to save your connection</b> by clicking the <b>Save</b> button, which will put
            the connection into the connection manager dropdown.<br />
            <b>A good practice when saving the connection, would be to save the connection without the password</b>. Passwords
            should only be saved "in your mind", in order to avoid intruders into systems.
        </li>
        <li><b>To use a previous saved connection</b>:<br />
            1. Select the previous saved connection from the dropdown<br />
            2. Click the button <b>Load</b>
            3. Click the button <b>Connect</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
