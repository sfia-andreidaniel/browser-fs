## The sources of OneDB console client

### Tribute to Free Pascal, Turbo Pascal, and Borland Pascal

As a tribute to Turbo Pascal, Borland Pascal and finally Free Pascal,
which were my first programming languages that I've learned, I wanted 
to make the binary of the OneDB console in the Pascal language.

This is more to demonstrate that language doesn't matter, but what does
it matters is the algorithm itself.

I love C / C++, I know they're faster, but this is my soul programming
language that I use as binary distribution under Linux. I'm a conservative
guy, so ... :)

Thank you
