## The sources of OneDB console client

### Building onedb client

You need to have the 'fpc' package (which stands for free pascal compiler).

> *apt-get install fpc*

After you have the fpc, hit *make.sh* to compile program.

### Tribute to Free Pascal, Turbo Pascal, and Borland Pascal

As a tribute to Turbo Pascal, Borland Pascal and finally Free Pascal,
which were my first programming languages that I've learned, I wanted
to make the binary of the OneDB console in the Pascal language.

This is more to demonstrate that language doesn't matter, but what does
it matters the most is the algorithm itself.

I love C / C++, I know they're optimized better, but this is my soul
programming language that I use as binary distribution under Linux.
I'm a conservative guy, so ... :)

Thank you
