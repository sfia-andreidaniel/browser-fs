<white>usage: </><green>prepare</> [ <red>-force</> ] <yellow>database</>
       or
       <green>prepare</> <yellow>environment</>

<white>arguments:</>
    <red>-force</> - optional argument, specifying that you know what you're
             doing. when you prepare a database, onedb will check to see if
             there is any existing data allready. if we find data in any mongo
             db collection, then the prepare script will be aborted without
             using the <red>-force</> argument.

    <yellow>database</> - use this command only once. the <green>prepare</> <yellow>database</>
             will creates necesarry tables in the database, necesarry indexes
             for collections, built-in users (root, anonymous), built-in groups
             (root, anonymous). <red>WARNING:</> any existing data will be lost
             upon completion of this command.

    <yellow>environment</> - use this command to ensure that everything is setup'ed
             good on a local onedb node. this command does not delete everything,
             in contrast with prepare database command, so it does not have any
             potential data-loss risk.
