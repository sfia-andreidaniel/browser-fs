<white>synopsys:</>
    the command <green>chmod</> is used to change a filesystem umask
    attribute (file mode bits).
    
<white>usage: </><green>chmod</> [<yellow>-r</>] <cyan>$mode</> <brown>$path</>

<white>arguments:</>
    <yellow>-r</> - weather the change of the <cyan>$mode</> to be propagated on
         all the objects that are children of the <brown>$path</> or not.
         
         this argument is optional, and it defaults to false.
         
    <cyan>$mode</> - mandatory argument, representing the new umask of the
         file or directory.
         
         <cyan>$mode</> can be expressed in the following formats:
            <cyan>octal</> - specify the umask in an octal representation
                like in traditional unix systems (eg: <cyan>755</>).
            <cyan>human readable:</> - specify the umask into a human readable
                format (eg: <cyan>rwx------</>). note that when specifying
                the umask in a human readable format abbreviations are not
                allowed, so the umask string must always contain 9 or 10
                characters (the 10'th character is the "t" sticky flag, which
                is optional).
    
    <brown>$path</> - mandatory argument, representing either
         a relative path, either an absolute path to the object in for which
         you want to change it's <cyan>$mode</>

<white>examples:</>
    <green>chmod</> <yellow>-r</> <cyan>777</> <brown>"/my files"</> - set the file 
        bits mode of "/my files" to "777" (octal representation). also, all sub-folders
        and folders of the "/my files" folder will have the same file mode from now on.
    <green>chmod</> <yellow>-r</> <cyan>rwxr--r--t</> <brown>"/my files"</> - set the file 
        bits mode of "/my files" to "rwxr--r--t" (human readable representation). 
        
            rwxr--r--t umask has the following meaning:
                owner can read, write, and execute
                group can only read
                the others can only read
                also a sticky fiag will be set
        
        also, all sub-folders
        and folders of the "/my files" folder will have the same file mode from now on.
